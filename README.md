Travelopia Task : 

@Problem : 
The assigned web-page has a problem. The conversion rate is not as high as it could be.
The Web Owner thinks that if the description content is shortened, the Users are more likely to see the Call To Action sections and thus more likely to book a Tour with us.


-Build a webpage for travelopia and solved a samlll problem of reducing some text and focusing on showing the "Call to Action" Button for increasing the chances of bookings. Tech stack used : HTML, CSS, Javascript, Netlify and github of course :)

@Includes Meta data for better Search engine optimization, Currently on Desktop, the benchmark hit 100/100 and on Mobile it 91/100. ---> Tags included meta description, author, character-set, viewport and keywords, making it a better webpage that can be displayed in the top results related to armania holdiays or travelopia holidays pack.

@Even performance of the application hit 100/100 benchmark. -> all the Performance benchmark are coming from the Chrome Lightroom (Developer Tool);
